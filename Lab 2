Perfect! If you want to complete both **Challenge 1 (SSH access)** and **Challenge 2 (Web server troubleshooting)** using **PuTTY** on Windows, follow the instructions below:

---

## ‚úÖ **Pre-requisites (One-Time Setup for PuTTY)**

Before you can SSH with PuTTY, convert your `.pem` key to `.ppk`.

### üîÅ Convert `.pem` to `.ppk` using PuTTYgen:

1. Open **PuTTYgen** (comes with PuTTY installation).
2. Click **Load**, change file type to `All Files (*.*)` and select your `.pem` key.
3. Click **Save private key** and save it as `my-key.ppk`.

---

## üîê **Challenge 1: Connect to the EC2 Instance Using PuTTY**

### üß≠ Step-by-Step:

1. Open **PuTTY**.

2. In **Host Name**, enter:

   ```
   ec2-user@<Public-DNS>
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   ec2-user@ec2-3-88-135-15.compute-1.amazonaws.com
   ```

3. On the left pane, go to:

   * `Connection > SSH > Auth`
   * Click **Browse** and select your `.ppk` private key (converted from .pem)

4. Click **Open** to connect.

### üîç If SSH Fails, Check These:

* **Security Group** ‚Üí Inbound rule should allow **SSH (port 22)** from your IP (or 0.0.0.0/0 for test)
* **Instance is Running**
* **Correct Key Pair**
* **Public IP/DNS exists**
* **Network ACL allows inbound SSH**
* **Correct username**: use `ec2-user` for Amazon Linux

---

### ‚úÖ Instructor Questions for Challenge 1:

* **Problem**: SSH access was blocked because security group did not allow port 22.
* **Fix**: Modified inbound rule in security group to allow SSH from my IP.

## üåê **Challenge 2: Troubleshoot the Web Server**

### üì° Step-by-Step in PuTTY:

1. SSH into instance via PuTTY as above.

2. Check web server (try Apache first):

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status httpd
   ```

3. If not installed, install and start it:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y httpd
   sudo systemctl start httpd
   sudo systemctl enable httpd
   ```

4. Check if the default web page is loading:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost
   ```

5. **Security Group** must allow **HTTP (port 80)**:

   * Go to EC2 ‚Üí Security Group ‚Üí Edit Inbound Rules ‚Üí Add rule:

     * Type: **HTTP**
     * Port: **80**
     * Source: **0.0.0.0/0**

6. Now, on your browser, open:

   ```
   http://<EC2 Public IP>
   ```

---

### ‚úÖ Instructor Questions for Challenge 2:

* **Problem**: Web server was not installed or not started. Also, port 80 was not open.
* **Fix**: Installed Apache (`httpd`), started the service, and allowed HTTP traffic in the security group.

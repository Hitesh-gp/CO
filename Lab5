Here are the **step-by-step commands** to complete the **"Task 3: Challenge - Synchronize Files With Amazon S3"** using the AWS CLI on your **EC2 instance**:

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 1: Download and Unzip the Sample Files**

```bash
wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/CUR-TF-200-RESOPS/lab5vocareum/files.zip
unzip files.zip
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 2: Enable Versioning on Your Amazon S3 Bucket**

Assuming your bucket name is `my-lab-bucket`. Replace it with your actual bucket name.

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-lab-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

To verify:

```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket my-lab-bucket
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 3: Sync Local Folder with Amazon S3 Bucket**

Assume your files were unzipped into a folder called `files`.

```bash
aws s3 sync files/ s3://my-lab-bucket
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 4: Delete a File Locally**

For example, delete `file1.txt`:

```bash
rm files/file1.txt
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 5: Sync Again With --delete Option**

This will delete `file1.txt` from S3 as well (but retains the previous version due to versioning):

```bash
aws s3 sync files/ s3://my-lab-bucket --delete
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 6: Recover the Deleted File Using Versioning**

#### üîç a) List All Versions of the Deleted File:

```bash
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket my-lab-bucket --prefix file1.txt
```

Look for the version ID of the file where `IsLatest=false` and `DeleteMarker=true` for the delete, and the earlier `VersionId` for the real content.

#### üíæ b) Download the Previous Version of the File:

```bash
aws s3api get-object --bucket my-lab-bucket --key file1.txt --version-id <version-id> file1.txt
```

Replace `<version-id>` with the correct version ID from the previous step.

#### üîÅ c) Move It Back to the Folder and Sync Again:

```bash
mv file1.txt files/
aws s3 sync files/ s3://my-lab-bucket
```

Let me know your bucket name if you want these commands customized.










Thanks for sharing the output. The issue is that you're trying to **download a delete marker version**, which is **not allowed** ‚Äî Amazon S3 throws a `MethodNotAllowed` error when you attempt to retrieve a version ID that corresponds to a **delete marker**.

### ‚úÖ Here's how to correctly **recover the previous version** of `file1.txt`:

From your output:

* **Delete marker VersionId (not usable for download)**: `JGMXWT45fLX6yEdZKKO6zJEVQzpd5bdO`
* ‚úÖ **Correct VersionId to download**: `cNkpuxsFztIUFh1tX39esnz17ZP90mh0` (the actual file)

---

### ‚úÖ Run this command instead:

```bash
aws s3api get-object --bucket hit1231 --key file1.txt --version-id cNkpuxsFztIUFh1tX39esnz17ZP90mh0 file1.txt
```

This will restore the deleted file `file1.txt` into your current EC2 directory.

---

### ‚úÖ (Optional) Sync it back to S3 if needed:

```bash
mv file1.txt files/
aws s3 sync files/ s3://hit1231
```

Let me know if you'd like to **remove the delete marker** as well (to make `file1.txt` the latest version).
